<h1> Path Finder </h1>
<ul>
  <li>The codes use dijkstra algorithm for finding shortest path</li>
  <li>For collision avoidance two methods are provided. </li>
  <li>One way is one bot will wait until the other bot completes the collision related node</li>
  <li>Second way is to move to nearby node from the designated path and wait for the bot to pass the collision related node</li>
</ul>
